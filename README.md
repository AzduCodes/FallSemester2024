# Fall Semester 2024
## Computer Science Principles
This is a place for me to showcase any school programming assignments, it will be used to document my learning progress throughout the years. 

This particular place is from my first semester, August 2024 to December 2024.
I started off by learning JavaScript, as such all of my programs in this repository are written in JavaScript.

While many of these programs are basic,  I feel I should still include them as evidence of my foundational knowledge.
